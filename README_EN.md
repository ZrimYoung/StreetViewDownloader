# 🏙️ Google Street View Bulk Image Downloader

This project includes a **GUI-based configuration editor** and a **multi-threaded main download program** that supports reading coordinates, calling the Google Maps API to stitch tiles, saving panorama images, and generating logs and result tables.

---

## 📁 1. File Structure

```
┌ GUI-RUN.py                 # GUI configuration editor
├ DOWNLOAD-Multithreads.py  # Multi-threaded Street View image downloader
├ configuration.ini         # Configuration file (auto-generated on first run)
├ POINTS.csv                # Input coordinates file (must include ID, Lat, Lng)
├ api_key.txt               # Google API Key file
└ output_dir/               # Output directory for downloaded images and logs
```

---

## 📦 2. Environment Setup

The project is built with **Python 3.7+**. A virtual environment is recommended.

### Install Python Dependencies

Run the following command to install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install pandas requests pillow tqdm
```

To run the GUI editor, Tkinter is also needed (included by default on most systems):
- Windows: pre-installed
- macOS: use system Python
- Linux (e.g., Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

---

## 🛠️ 3. How to Use the Project

### 1️⃣ Prepare Your Data

- `POINTS.csv`: contains point info with `ID`, `Lat`, `Lng`
- `api_key.txt`: contains your Google API Key

---

### 2️⃣ Edit Configuration with GUI (Recommended)

Run the configuration editor:

```bash
python GUI-RUN.py
```

Or run the packaged executable:

```bash
SVIDownloaderConfiguration.exe
```

Configurable parameters include:
- File paths
- Batch count
- Image tile stitching size
- Sleep time between requests

First run will automatically generate `configuration.ini` and log templates.

---

### 3️⃣ Start the Download Program

Run the main script:

```bash
python DOWNLOAD.py # (Single-threaded)
```
or
```bash
python DOWNLOAD-Multithreads.py # (Multi-threaded)
```

Features:
- Automatically create session and get panoId
- Download and stitch tiles concurrently
- Live progress display (`tqdm`)
- Skip completed/failed records (configurable retry)
- Output images, failure logs, and batch results

---

## 🛠️ 4. Configuration File Structure

The program uses `configuration.ini` for all parameters. It contains three main sections:

### [PATHS] Path Settings
- `csv_path`: input CSV with coordinates
- `api_key_path`: file with your API key
- `save_dir`: output folder for images
- `log_path`: file to log successful downloads
- `fail_log_path`: file to record failed attempts
- `detailed_log_path`: file for detailed runtime logs

### [PARAMS] Download Parameters
- `retry_failed_points`: whether to retry failed points (True/False)
- `batch_size`: max number of images per batch
- `num_batches`: total batch cycles
- `max_point_workers`: number of concurrent threads

### [TILES] Tile Parameters
- `zoom`: zoom level (0–5)
- `tile_size`: pixel size of each tile
- `tile_cols`, `tile_rows`: number of tiles per row/column
- `sleeptime`: interval between requests (seconds)

GUI provides presets (Zoom 0–5) or allows custom tile settings.

## 📐 5. Tile Parameters Overview

Based on [Google Maps Tile API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/tile/streetview?hl=en), different `zoom` levels affect image resolution and tile count:

| `zoom` | Image Size (px)      | Suggested tile_cols × tile_rows |
|--------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0      | 512 × 256             | 1 × 1                         |
| 1      | 1024 × 512            | 2 × 1                         |
| 2      | 2048 × 1024           | 4 × 2                         |
| 3      | 4096 × 2048           | 8 × 4                         |
| 4      | 6656 × 3328           | 13 × 7                        |
| 5      | 13312 × 6656          | 26 × 13                       |

Example:
```ini
zoom = 2
tile_size = 512
tile_cols = 4
tile_rows = 2
```

✅ Easily configured via `GUI-RUN.py` or executable. Auto-generates config and logs on first use.

## 🌐 6. Google Maps Tile API Overview

The project uses the [Google Maps Tile API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/tile/streetview?hl=en) to retrieve images.

### 🔑 Get an API Key

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project and enable:
   - Maps Tile API
   - Street View Static API (optional backup)
3. Generate an API key and save it to `api_key.txt`

### 🗺️ Image Download Workflow

1. **Create a session**
   - POST to `https://tile.googleapis.com/v1/createSession` with `"mapType": "streetview"`
   - Receive `session token`

2. **Get panoId**
   - POST coordinates to the `panoIds` endpoint

3. **Download tiles**
   - Use this format:

     ```
     https://tile.googleapis.com/v1/streetview/tiles/{zoom}/{x}/{y}?session=...&key=...&panoId=...
     ```

4. **Stitch the image**
   - Combine tiles into one panorama and save to `save_dir`

---

## 📁 7. Output Description

After successful runs, the following files will be generated:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `output_dir/*.jpg` | Final stitched panorama images |
| `download_log.csv` | Log of successful downloads |
| `failed_log.csv` | Failed points and reasons |
| `results_batch_*.csv` | Per-batch result summaries |
| `detailed_run.log` | Full log including exceptions |

---

## ❗ 8. Common Issues & Tips

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 403 or no session | Check if API has Tile API and Street View Static API enabled |
| Blank image | Possibly invalid panoId or tile config error |
| High failure rate | Increase `sleeptime` to avoid rate limits |
| `.exe` can't write files | Avoid protected directories like `C:\` or desktop |
| Missing Tkinter | Install `python3-tk` or use system Python |
